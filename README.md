Resolving Structure in the Debris Disk around HD 206893 with ALMA


From June 2019 - January 2021, I worked at Wesleyan University Astronomy Department and Van Vleck Observatory under the guidance of Dr. A. Meredith Hughes. This repository contains the code that helped achieve the results in our paper: https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021arXiv210108849N/abstract 

Note: flat disk and continuous disk refer to the same thing. File paths need to be adjusted accordingly.
